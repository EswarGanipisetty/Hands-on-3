No, the Modified Function will not effect the result.

The reason is that the additional operations involving y = i + j; in the modified function are not used in the #1 function. 
The original runtime analysis [#1] is focused on the operations inside the nested loops that contribute to the time complexity, 
and the modified function does not change the critical parts of the original algorithm [#1] 
that lead to the O(n^2) time complexity. 
Therefore, the results obtained for the original algorithm [#1] should remain valid despite the modified function.
