Yes, the modification to the algorithm, 
introducing an additional loop with the line y = i + j;
will likely increase the time it takes for the algorithm to run.
The new line adds more computations within the nested loop, contributing to a higher time complexity.
Therefore, the modification is expected to result in a longer runtime for the algorithm compared to the original version without the additional loop.
