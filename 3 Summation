1. Upper Bound (Big-O): 
Opt for a higher-degree polynomial, 
such as cubic (g(n) = dn³+ en²+ fng), 
which grows faster than the quadratic curve: g(n) dn³+ en² + fn+g If g(n) 
serves as a tight upper bound, 
it can be expressed using big-O notation: f(n) = O(n³)

2. Lower Bound (Big-Omega): Select a lower-degree polynomial, 
like linear (h(n) = kn+1),
that grows slower than the quadratic curve: h(n)=kn+1 If h(n) acts as a tight lower bound, 
it can be expressed using big-Omega notation: f(n) = (n)

3. Tight Bound (Big-Theta): When both upper and lower bounds are closely aligned, 
express the behavior using big-Theta notation: f(n) = (n²)
